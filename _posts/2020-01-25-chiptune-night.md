Online radio station [Nightride FM](https://nightride.fm/?station=nightride) is diverting from their usual synthwave showcasting tomorrow evening to try out something new: a chiptune focused radio show titled Chiptune Night. The show, hosted by Dan Butler of the explosive chiptune/synthwave/metal fusion band [Techno Mage](https://technomage.bandcamp.com/), will be primarily focused on showing off recent chiptune & chiptune inspired releases from a variety of different artists.

Tomorrowâ€™s premiere is set to include tracks from a plethora of different chiptune artists including the likes of [Ansonix](https://www.youtube.com/user/AntonCullenMusic/videos), [Miles Matrix](https://miles-matrix.com/home), and even longtime CC collaborators [Tobikomi](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAWgklXUqYbr6On2eLF-zWw) and [SuperJet Spade](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBFhNu1wsJbahAcA8MlfaIw), among others. Additionally, featured artist [3xBlast](http://3xblast.com/3xblast.com/) will also be on the show as a special guest, and will be interviewed at some point by Butler.

Chiptune Night will premiere at 7 PM CST tomorrow night (January 26th). You can tune in via the [Nightride FM website](https://nightride.fm/?station=nightride) or on their [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/nightride_fm), [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Qw6L7TZZCY) or [Periscope](https://www.pscp.tv/nightridefm/1BdGYeyNoQzGX) livestreams.
