[discord-invite]: https://discord.gg/dpHG83b "Chiptune Café Discord Server Invite"

The Chiptune Café is an online community made up of chiptune artists, chipdev programmers, old VGM enthusiasts and demosceners, brought together by our common love of chip music and the retro aesthetic. We originated in 2016 as a small Discord server for chiptune artists and enthusiasts to chill in, but as time as passed and the Café has gotten bigger, we’ve expanded into other ventures as well, such as our blog and hosting music jams. Our main goal as a community is to bring people from all across the chipscene together so they can network, learn from one another, and have a platform to show off their awesome projects and creations.

Like we mentioned, the Café has its hands in a lot of different projects. We host a lot of different contests and events directed towards chipsceners, the most prevalent being our recurring Chip Jams, battle-of-the-bands type contests where chiptune composers compete to see who can make the best track while abiding to a predetermined set of rules. There’s also our Café Blog, where we write about everything from important chipscene news to underground indie releases, and even some old retro history from time to time.
